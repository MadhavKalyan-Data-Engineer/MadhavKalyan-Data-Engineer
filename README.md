# 👋 Hi, I'm CH Madhav Kalyan

Cloud Data Engineer with hands-on experience designing, building, and operating scalable data pipelines on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).  
Experienced in batch and event-driven data processing, analytics enablement, and production-grade orchestration using Apache Airflow, PySpark, Dataflow, Dataproc, and BigQuery.

I have a strong background in supply chain and logistics analytics, delivering reliable, high-volume data solutions with built-in data quality checks, validation controls, reconciliation, and security governance.
